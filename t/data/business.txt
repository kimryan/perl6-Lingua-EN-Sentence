A string followed by 2 carriage returns denotes a sentence, even though it doesn't end in a dot
 
Dots after single letters such as U.S.A. or in numbers like -12.34 will not cause a split
as well as common abbreviations such as Mr. J. Smith, 2 Jones St.   Ariz.   XYZ Pty. Ltd. and more.
Sequences like ellipsis ... OR . . will not cause a split.
A sentence ending in an acronym does not cause a split such as St. There are 
"Some valid cases cannot be detected", such as so said I. This cannot easily be separated
 from a valid single letter-dot sequence like the initial for a person's given name.
Numbered sections such as point 1. within a sentence will not cause a split.
